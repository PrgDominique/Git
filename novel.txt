CULTURAL HERITAGE
Traditionally, cultural heritage is an expression of the various ways of living developed by a society and passed on through generations, including customs, practices, objects, artistic expressions, and values. Cultural heritage is often expressed as either tangible or intangible.

As part of human activity, cultural heritage generally produces tangible representations of its value systems, beliefs, traditions, and lifestyles—such as visual art and architecture—as well as the intangible, which includes voices, values, traditions, oral history, spiritual ceremonies, and storytelling.

ALL strives to preserve and safeguard the intangible along with the tangible. An example is the priceless cultural wisdom traditions of the East which are documented in the rich and varied book culture that has been produced over centuries.
